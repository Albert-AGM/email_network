# PREDICTING A MANAGEMENT JOB POSITION

In this data science project I combine network analysis and supervised machine learning to predict given an email network of a company, what employees are receiving a management salary. In addition, I will review some concepts of machine learning as well as basic steps to follow in a machine learning project.

Check it out in the jupyter notebook email_network.ipynb or in [link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Albert-GM/email_network/blob/master/email_network.html)!
